The Duras-Europos is a historically significant ancient site nested along the Euphrates river in modern-day Syria. Often withn the borderlands of border disputes and conflicts between Western and Eastern powers, the cultural complexity of this region is expressed both in its modern title and in historical occurances and artifacts. This historical and cultural plurality and local leadership in archaelogical work is rarely highlighted in contemporary Western engagement with the region. It is the aim of tools such as this map and of collaborative, open research to give a platform to the true history of the site, encompassing all of the ebbs and flows of cultural influences that come with exchanges of empires in power.
